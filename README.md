# -SMART_-CAR_-PARKING_-USING_-ARDUINO_-UNO
My Project name is Smart Car Parking by Arduino. This project save time for people who want to park their car, If there's no place for the gate will not open for car and If parking have available place lcd will print out the remaining places.  For Tinkercad Simulation https://www.tinkercad.com/things/bHAhMxh6ZnV-smart-car-parking .  In this Project I have used:  Arduino Uno Servo Motors * 2 PIR Sensor * 2 Breadboard LCD 12X2
